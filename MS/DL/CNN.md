Note: Conventionally, we associate white color with higher pixel values and black color with lower pixel values, but for explanation and visualization, we have reversed this. The values of pixels vary between 0 to 255; white is represented by 255, while black by 0. SME has used the values reversibly where the black dots are represented by 200, and the lighter parts have values like 0.
