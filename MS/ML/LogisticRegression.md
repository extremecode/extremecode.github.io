Use the test dataset to check the model generalizability, if you tune the model based on the test dataset the results achieved will be questionable. 

You can handle the variability in a data set caused by random chance in these two ways:

Collect more unseen data for testing

Cross-validate the training data

Cross-validation is a popular technique used in ensemble models. You will learn about cross-validation later in the course. 

You learned how to build a supervised machine learning model. 

We discussed the principle of generalizability.

Next, you briefly learned about overfitting and underfitting.

Further, you understood how splitting a data set into training, validation, and test data sets can be beneficial when evaluating a modelâ€™s performance.

You learned about the limitations of splitting a data set.

 Before you learn these metrics, you need to understand an important concept: positive and negative classes. All the examples of classification models we have discussed so far had only two classes. For instance, in the case of credit approval, the classes were 'Approve credit' or 'Not approve credit.' In the case of the tumor detection model, the classes were 'cancerous tumor' or 'non-cancerous tumor.' Classification models with two classes are called binary class classification models. Later in this module, we will discuss examples with multiple classes in output.
