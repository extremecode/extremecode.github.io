# Hypothesis Testing

As we know, Inferential statistics enables you to make “inferences” about the Population mean from the sample data when you have no clue about the Population.

However, sometimes, you have some assumption/estimate about the Population mean to start with, and you want to confirm the validity of these assumptions/estimates using sample data.



 
* Applications of hypothesis testing,
* Null and alternate hypotheses, and
* Two methods to find the validity of a claim:
* Critical value method
* P-value method

ex - 
-- Let's say an e-commerce company wants to decide between two variants of a button: "Shop now" and "Buy now". Although it may seem insignificant, practically speaking, it has been observed that improving the UI/UX design can have enormous benefits for the company. In such cases, we perform A/B testing, which is a subset of hypothesis testing.

-- Another important area where hypothesis testing is extensively used is checking the validity of machine learning models. As the course progresses, you will learn how to build and validate various machine learning models. This is where hypothesis testing will come handy.

 

-- Any product that you buy comes with a warranty. Electronic products generally come with a one-year warranty, whereas car manufacturers give a 3–10-year warranty depending on the components of the car. These claims are majorly driven by hypothesis testing.
