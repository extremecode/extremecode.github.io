# Hypothesis Testing

As we know, Inferential statistics enables you to make “inferences” about the Population mean from the sample data when you have no clue about the Population.

However, sometimes, you have some assumption/estimate about the Population mean to start with, and you want to confirm the validity of these assumptions/estimates using sample data.
